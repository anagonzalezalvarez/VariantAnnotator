1. Downloaded form gnomAD website: https://storage.googleapis.com/gcp-public-data--gnomad/release/2.1.1/liftover_grch38/vcf/exomes/gnomad.exomes.r2.1.1.sites.liftover_grch38.vcf.bgz

3. Filtered by quality and allele frequency
   - bcftools view -f PASS -i 'AF>0.05' gnomad.exomes.r2.1.1.sites.liftover_grch38.vcf.bgz > pass_common.vcf

2. Split into chromosomes with bcftools
   - /ibex/scratch/projects/c2102/databases/gnomad_v2.1.1_liftover/chr##.vcf

Processing:
1. Annotated with VEP
   - /ibex/scratch/projects/c2102/databases/gnomad_v2.1.1_liftover/chr#/chr#_x##.vcf.vep

2. Select variants that contain 'missense_variant' in the 'Consequence' column (from VEP)

3. Filter out variants that contain 'pathogenic' or 'risk' in the clinical significance (CLIN_SIG column from VEP)

6. Select variants where the RefSeq ID (RefSeq column) is equal to the transcript indicated in the MANE_SELECT or MANE_PLUS_CLINICAL columns (from VEP)

7. Obtained UniProt IDs for each variant, from two sources (sometimes there's more than 1 UniProt ID for a given transcript):
   a) UNIPROT_ISOFORM column (from VEP)
   b) UniProt database (/ibex/projects/c2102/databases/uniprot/2023_02/current_release/knowledgebase/idmapping/by_organism/HUMAN_9606_idmapping.dat.gz)

8. Get the AlphaFold model for each transcript, from two sources:
   a) MANE dataset from the AlphaFold Database (/ibex/scratch/projects/c2102/databases/alphafold/alphafold_human_v4)
   b) Regular AlphaFold Database (/ibex/scratch/projects/c2102/databases/alphafold/alphafold_mane)

   Checked that the sequence length and residue match.

9. Obtained intra-molecular contacts (6 Angstroms away)

10. Obtained catalytic sites for residue of interest and residues 8 Angstroms away (with function from variant_annotator.structure_features.catalyticSites)

11. Annotated AlphaFold models with DSSP to calculate secondary structure and surface accessible area for every residue, and extracted the values for the variants.

12. Extracted pLDDT scores in a window of 5 residues centered around the residue of interest (proxy for disorder)

13. Annotated with FoldX


Potentially useful columns:

UniProt_IDs          list of UniProt IDs found for this transcript
PDB_path             path to the AF model
intra_contacts       list of intra-molecular contacts (currently 8 A away, will change to 6)
is_catalytic         if the residue of interest of any residue 8 A away is annotated as catalytic
pLDDT                mean pLDDT for 5-residue window centered in residue of interest
secondary_structre   secondary structure assignment by DSSP (see Output_short section in https://swift.cmbi.umcn.nl/gv/dssp/)
accessibility        residue water exposed surface in Angstrom**2, as annotated by DSSP
SIFT                 pathogenicity score (Stefan didn't like it)
PolyPhen             pathogenicity score (Stefan didn't like it)
Conservation         conservation score from the Ensembl Compara database. GERP scores from the EPO 35 way mammalian alignment. Positive scores represent highly-conserved positions while negative scores represent highly-variable positions.
BLOSUM62             score for conservative vs nonconservative amino acid changes (https://www.labxchange.org/library/items/lb:LabXchange:24d0ec21:lx_image:1#:~:text=BLOSUM%20scores%20for%20substituting%20the,are%20classified%20as%20non%2Dconservative.)
DOMAINS              names of overlapping protein domains from different sources
last 22 columns from FoldX     https://foldxsuite.crg.eu/command/BuildModel
