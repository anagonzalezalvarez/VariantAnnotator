Retrieval:
1. Cecilia sent me file `PAVS_8_nodup.csv`. This was the starting point.

   Note: In the file there are 912 variants, but only 750 unique variants according to the values in the hgvsAllele column.

Processing:
1. Annotated with VEP
   - First extracted the hgvs IDs from the file and saved them to `hgvs_variants.txt` to give them as input to VEP
   - Ran with `run_vep.sbatch`, and produced the file `hgvs_variants.txt.vep` in vcf format

   Note: there were annotations only for 767 variants. The rest were not found with the provided sequence ID.

2. Select variants that contain 'missense_variant' in the 'Consequence' column (from VEP)

3. Combine add the following annotations from the `PAVS_8_nodup.csv` file:
   - hgvsAllele
   - geneSymbol
   - protein
   - zygosityLabel : combined the values for multiple individuals with the same variant into a list
   - phenoLabels : combined the values for multiple individuals with the same variant into a list
   - sex : combined the values for multiple individuals with the same variant into a list

   Note: there are 8 entries where the gene symbol from PAVS doesn't match with the gene symbol given by VEP, but the names are similar so I just left it like that


4. Select variants where the RefSeq ID (RefSeq column) is equal to the transcript indicated in the MANE_SELECT or MANE_PLUS_CLINICAL columns from VEP (728 variants).

5. Select variants where the mutated amino acids' identity and position match from `PAVS_8_nodup.csv` and the VEP annotations (611 variants).

7. Obtained UniProt IDs for each variant, from two sources (sometimes there's more than 1 UniProt ID for a given transcript):
   a) UNIPROT_ISOFORM column (from VEP)
   b) UniProt database (/ibex/projects/c2102/databases/uniprot/2023_02/current_release/knowledgebase/idmapping/by_organism/HUMAN_9606_idmapping.dat.gz)

8. Get the AlphaFold model for each transcript, from two sources:
   a) MANE dataset from the AlphaFold Database (/ibex/scratch/projects/c2102/databases/alphafold/alphafold_human_v4)
   b) Regular AlphaFold Database (/ibex/scratch/projects/c2102/databases/alphafold/alphafold_mane)

   Note: Checked that the sequence length and residue match.

9. Removed variants with no PDB model found (578 left).

10. Obtained intra-molecular contacts (6 Angstroms away)

11. Obtained catalytic sites for residue of interest and residues 8 Angstroms away (with function from variant_annotator.structure_features.catalyticSites)

12. Annotated AlphaFold models with DSSP to calculate secondary structure and surface accessible area for every residue, and extracted the values for the variants.

13. Extracted pLDDT scores in a window of 5 residues centered around the residue of interest (proxy for disorder)

14. Annotated with FoldX

15. Removed duplicated variants (481 left)


Total unique variants left: 481

Why:
- Many transcript IDs reported were not found by VEP, or the residue numbers didn't match between VEP and PAVS (~250)
- Selected variants with a canonical transcript from MANE (removed ~50)
- Excluded variants with no pre-calculated AlphaFold model (~30)
- Removed duplicated variants from the remaining (~100)




Potentially useful columns:

UniProt_IDs          list of UniProt IDs found for this transcript
PDB_path             path to the AF model
intra_contacts       list of intra-molecular contacts (currently 8 A away, will change to 6)
is_catalytic         if the residue of interest of any residue 8 A away is annotated as catalytic
pLDDT                mean pLDDT for 5-residue window centered in residue of interest
secondary_structre   secondary structure assignment by DSSP (see Output_short section in https://swift.cmbi.umcn.nl/gv/dssp/)
accessibility        residue water exposed surface in Angstrom**2, as annotated by DSSP
SIFT                 pathogenicity score (Stefan didn't like it)
PolyPhen             pathogenicity score (Stefan didn't like it)
Conservation         conservation score from the Ensembl Compara database. GERP scores from the EPO 35 way mammalian alignment. Positive scores represent highly-conserved positions while negative scores represent highly-variable positions.
BLOSUM62             score for conservative vs nonconservative amino acid changes (https://www.labxchange.org/library/items/lb:LabXchange:24d0ec21:lx_image:1#:~:text=BLOSUM%20scores%20for%20substituting%20the,are%20classified%20as%20non%2Dconservative.)
DOMAINS              names of overlapping protein domains from different sources
